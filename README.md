⏳ Daily Practice Routine

I dedicate 8–17 hours/day (depending on energy & focus) across:

✅ DSA + Leetcode (2–3 hrs)

✅ AI/ML + Deep Learning (2–3 hrs)

✅ System Design & Architecture (1–2 hrs)

✅ Projects / APIs / Automation (1–2 hrs)

✅ C++ / Java / Python OOP (1 hr)

✅ GitHub / CI/CD / Portfolio (30–60 mins)

✅ Reading / Strategy / Planning (30–60 mins)

💡 Some days are 8 hours. Some go up to 17. But I show up daily.
