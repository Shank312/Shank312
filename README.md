## 📈 Daily Practice Routine

⏱️ I aim to put in **8–17 hours/day**, depending on energy, focus, and priority.

🧠 **Core Focus Areas** (tracked daily):
- ✅ DSA + Leetcode (2–3 hrs)  
- ✅ AI/ML + Deep Learning (2–3 hrs)  
- ✅ System Design / Software Architecture (1–2 hrs)  
- ✅ Projects / Automation / API Development (1–2 hrs)  
- ✅ C++ / Java / Python OOP Practice (1 hr)  
- ✅ GitHub / CI-CD / Portfolio Enhancements (30–60 mins)  
- ✅ Reading / Strategy / Planning (30–60 mins)

💡 *Some days are 8 hours. Some go up to 17. But I show up daily.*
